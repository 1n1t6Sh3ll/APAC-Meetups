| [Ruxmon Melbourne](https://ruxmon.com/melbourne/)	|  Last Friday	| Monthly	| Each month two speakers from the local security community will share their knowledge on a security topic ranging from introductory/beginner level to more advanced topics.

If you're interested in IT Security and related topics, looking to learn a bit more, or want to meet up with fellow security people, then you should definitely check out a meeting.

Ruxmon is a true grass-roots event. There are no sales pitches, no membership fees, and it is not a thinly veiled attempt to promote the services or personalities of an affiliated company. Weâ€™re just about good content, drinks, and discussion.	| CBD, Melbourne. |
| [AllSec](https://www.meetup.com/All-Sec/) | First Thursday | Monthly | All Sec is an informal community-driven meetup for those looking to learn new skills and meet like-minded people from the infosec industry. The infosec space is vast, and we want to encourage people to share their diverse knowledge and experience through presentations, technical demos and hands-on challenges.

We would like our presenters to share war stories and walk through how they managed to achieve their goal/ outcome. The type of information that can be taken away and practised elsewhere for better results. | CBD, Melbourne. |
